# CC_LeitTHau
Clean Code Project from Bodo Thausing and Claudia Leitinger

This prokject is a Webcrawler which also translates the headers of the sides and saves it in a markdown.md file, which you find in the project unter recources. 

To build and run, edit the run configurations and add the website you want to crawl, the depth and the target language you want the headers translated into. 
Seperate them by space. (e.g. https://www.bodofoto.at/ 3 DE)

Translator API used: 
Google Translator via rapidapi.com
